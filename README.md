# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis on Sales Data
This repository contains a Python notebook that performs multiple linear regression analysis on a sales dataset. The goal of this analysis is to understand how different factors affect sales.

## Libraries Used
NumPy: Used for efficient mathematical and logical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numeric data.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides special data structures and data analysis tools, which makes working with structured data easy.
## Data
The data used in this analysis is stored in the (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dinishalikha/dataset-penjualan). The data is read using the pandas library.

## Code Structure
The code first imports the necessary libraries (numpy and pandas). It then lists all the files in the ../input/ directory using the os.walk function. The full path of each file is printed to the console.

## Output
The code can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All". Temporary files can be written to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session.

## How to Run
To run the code, click "run" or press "Shift+Enter".
